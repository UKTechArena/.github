## Welcome to the 2022 UK Tech Arena GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

In teams of 2-4, we need YOU to plunge into the virtual realms of the unknown and create lossless geometry/mesh compression scheme designs with random access to a given set of mesh resources.

By challenging your skills, teaming up with your peers, and collaborating with industry experts - youâ€™ll not only be creating groundbreaking solutions for generations to come, but youâ€™ll also win some amazing prizes too.

### Start Building
Create a new repository for your project within this GitHub organization. You can use one of the templates we have provided as starting points.

- [example-ai-template](https://github.com/UKTechArena/example-ai-template)
- [example-non-ai-template](https://github.com/UKTechArena/example-non-ai-template)

Make sure all your team members have access to your repository. To add them go to `Settings` then `Collaborators and teams`.

### Score calculation
Once you have created your repository request `GitHub Actions` to be configured in the [#support](https://app.slack.com/client/T0447CNHDT2/C046F57C0C8) channel on Slack.

You will then be able see the score for each build on the `Actions` tab of your repository.

Your solution will be tested each time you push your code to GitHub or create a pull request. The system will calculate a score based on weighted mean of compression ratio, inverse of decompression time and quality of decompressed output as compared to original input.

You can use multiple branches to test different algorithms but only the score for code in the `main` branch will be submitted.

### Support
If you need help with something please let us know in the [#support](https://app.slack.com/client/T0447CNHDT2/C046F57C0C8) channel on Slack.
