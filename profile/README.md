## Welcome to the 2022 UK Tech Arena Hackathon! ðŸ‘‹

A short introduction. What is the hackathon all about?

### How to Register
To join the hackathon please head over to the [registration form](https://www.bemyapp.com/).

Make sure all your team members also register with the same team name.

### Start Building
Once you have registered you will be given access to the GitHub and Slack accounts for the hackathon. Each team has a prive Git repository to which you need to push all your code. You can use multiple branches to test different algorithms but only the score for code in the `main` branch will be submitted.

### Automatic Testing
Your solution will be tested each time you push code to GitHub or create a pull request. The system will calculate a score based on your compression time and quality.

### Solution Scores
You can see the score for each build on the `Actions` tab of your repository.

The score for your `main` branch will be submitted to the [scoreboard](https://www.bemyapp.com/) and used to determine the hackathon winners.

### Support
If you need help with something please let us know in the [#support](https://www.bemyapp.com/) channel on Slack.
